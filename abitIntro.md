- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rocketbrocolli
-  Iâ€™m interested in Game Development and Web FrontEnd Development
-  Iâ€™m currently learning pixelart and also little bit of both development!
-  I hope we can share each other in programming and design industries


my Main Focus right now is making portofolios on Game development using Unity!
and also i want to mastering front end web development using React!

i know it's an long way road before i could create something from both development!
but there's no excuse that i can't do this right??? 
Kudos!!!
